# Offensive Security Research Config for Claude Code

A comprehensive Claude Code configuration tailored for security researchers, red teamers, and vulnerability analysts. Includes 25 specialized skills, 6 agents, and 46 vulnerability reference files covering the full offensive security lifecycle.

## Quick Setup

```bash
# Method 1: Plugin marketplace (recommended)
git clone https://github.com/hypnguyen1209/offensive-claude.git ~/offensive-claude
# Then in Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add ~/offensive-claude
/plugin install offensive-claude
```

```bash
# Method 2: One-liner install (copies to ~/.claude/)
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hypnguyen1209/offensive-claude/main/install.sh | bash
```

```bash
# Method 3: Manual clone
git clone https://github.com/hypnguyen1209/offensive-claude.git ~/offensive-claude
cp -r ~/offensive-claude/plugins/offensive-claude/skills ~/.claude/skills
cp -r ~/offensive-claude/plugins/offensive-claude/agents ~/.claude/agents
cp ~/offensive-claude/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

Skills and agents activate automatically — no additional configuration needed.

## Vulnerability References (47 files)

Detailed patterns with vulnerable/secure code examples, organized by category:

- **Taint Analysis** (4): source-sink tracing, filter evaluation, threat model, false positive reduction
- **Memory Safety** (7): buffer overflow, integer overflow, UAF, null deref, OOB read, unsafe Rust
- **Injection** (11): SQL, command, XSS, SSRF, SSTI, XXE, deserialization, path traversal, file upload, prototype pollution, ReDoS
- **Authentication** (8): bypass, authorization flaws, session management, hardcoded creds, default creds, brute force, permissions
- **Cryptography** (4): weak algorithms, key management, side-channel, certificate validation
- **Concurrency** (3): race conditions, TOCTOU, established patterns
- **Web/API** (5): CORS, CSRF, open redirect, resource exhaustion, API security
- **Supply Chain** (3): dependency confusion, code integrity, ML model files
- **Active Directory** (1): delegation, GPO abuse, RODC, SCCM/WSUS, ADCS, trust attacks

## MCP Servers

| Server | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| mitm-search | Web search via mcp.mitm.vn |
| ida-multi-mcp | IDA Pro integration (decompile, rename, xrefs, patching) |
| jadx-mcp-server | Android APK decompilation and analysis |

## How It Works

1. Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` as the system prompt — sets offensive security persona
2. Skills activate contextually based on your question/task
3. Agents can be spawned as sub-agents for parallel or specialized work
4. Reference files are loaded on-demand when deeper vulnerability patterns are needed

## Customization

- Add new skills: create `plugins/offensive-claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter
- Add new agents: create `plugins/offensive-claude/agents/<name>.md` with role description
- Add MCP servers: edit `mcpServers` in `settings.json`
- Modify permissions: edit `permissions.allow` in `settings.json`

## Requirements

- Claude Code CLI, Desktop App, or VS Code extension
- For MCP integrations: IDA Pro with ida-multi-mcp plugin, JADX with MCP server
